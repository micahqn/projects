 player answered with: ryder you answered with: 
Alright, Ryder, welcome to Eldoria. The very air here hums with untold possibilities... and untold dangers. Let's see if you have what it takes to survive.

**The Setting:**

*   **The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke. The village of Oakhaven, your starting point, is a collection of thatched-roof huts huddled within a palisade of sharpened logs. The distant howl of a wolf pierces the twilight. The sky is a canvas of bruised purples and fiery oranges as the sun dips below the horizon.**

**Scenario 1: The Raid**

You awaken to the sounds of screaming and clashing steel. Oakhaven is under attack! Goblins, crude and vicious, swarm through the village, looting and setting fire to buildings. You quickly grab the worn leather jerkin, rusty short sword, and small pouch of coins you started with.

**Question 1:**

Your immediate instinct is to:

A) Flee into the nearby forest. Survival is paramount, and you're no soldier.

B) Attempt to defend a group of villagers huddled near the well. They look terrified and desperate.

C) Head towards the longhouse, hoping to find the village elder and any able-bodied defenders.

**Your Choice? (A, B, or C)**
 player answered with: b you answered with: 
Alright, Ryder, you chose to defend the villagers huddled near the well. A noble, but risky choice!

**Scenario 1: The Raid (Continued)**

As you rush towards the group, a goblin wielding a crude axe lunges at a young woman. You intercept the blow with your rusty short sword. The goblin snarls, revealing rows of jagged teeth. It’s surprisingly strong, and the impact jars your arm. Other goblins are swarming closer, drawn by the sound of combat.

**Question 2:**

You parry the goblin's attack and now have a brief window of opportunity. Do you:

A) Focus all your effort on killing the goblin in front of you, hoping to quickly eliminate one threat.

B) Shove the woman behind you, trying to create some distance between you and the attackers.

C) Yell loudly to try and draw the attention of other defenders and hopefully distract the goblins.

**Your Choice? (A, B, or C)**
 player answered with: b you answered with: 
Alright, Ryder, you chose to shove the woman behind you, prioritizing distance. A wise move, given the odds.

**Scenario 1: The Raid (Continued)**

The woman stumbles backward, giving you a precious moment. The goblin, momentarily surprised, loses its footing slightly. However, two more goblins, smaller but quicker, now dart towards you, brandishing daggers. They clearly intend to flank you. The villagers behind you are screaming, drawing even more attention.

**Question 3:**

With two goblins flanking you and the first one recovering, you:

A) Attempt to target the goblin that is recovering and make him stumble again, making it easier to run.

B) Focus on the closer goblin with the dagger to try to get rid of the imminent threat

C) Throw a handful of the coins from your pouch at the goblins, hoping to distract them long enough to reposition yourself.

**Your Choice? (A, B, or C)**
 player answered with: c you answered with: 
Alright, Ryder, you opted for a gamble, throwing your coins at the goblins.

**Scenario 1: The Raid (Outcome)**

The coins scatter across the muddy ground. The closest goblin is momentarily distracted, its eyes gleaming greedily as it snatches at the falling coins. The second goblin is less impressed and continues its advance. However, the distraction *does* buy you a precious moment.

You manage to sidestep the lunging dagger of the second goblin, narrowly avoiding a nasty wound. Capitalizing on the momentary chaos, you sprint towards the longhouse, hoping to find some real resistance. The villagers, left behind, are now in a more precarious situation, but you’ve bought them a little time, and the goblins are more focused on the coins.

**The Setting:**

*   **The air is thick with smoke, making you cough. The stench of burning thatch and goblin musk assaults your nostrils. The longhouse looms ahead, its entrance flickering with torchlight. You can hear the clang of steel from within, a desperate defense against the goblin horde.**

**Scenario 2: The Longhouse**

Reaching the longhouse, you find a handful of villagers, armed with farming tools and a few rusty weapons, desperately holding the line against a swarm of goblins trying to force their way inside. The village elder, a wizened old woman named Elara, is shouting orders, her voice surprisingly strong despite her age. A single, battered-looking knight, recognizable by his dented breastplate and broken sword, is fighting fiercely near the doorway.

**Question 4:**

As you approach the longhouse, you see the knight get overwhelmed by three goblins. He falls to his knees. Do you:

A) Immediately join the fight at the doorway, focusing on supporting the knight and preventing the goblins from breaching the longhouse.

B) Scan the perimeter for a better position, perhaps a side window or a higher vantage point, to get a better view of the battlefield and potentially find a weaker point to attack.

C) Approach Elara and ask for instructions, believing that following her orders is the best way to contribute to the defense of the longhouse.

**Your Choice? (A, B, or C)**
