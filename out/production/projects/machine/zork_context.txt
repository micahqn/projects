Greetings, potential lord! Welcome to the untamed lands. Before we begin, tell me, what is your name, the name by which your village shall know its leader?

Alright, let's begin, Lord <Player Name>!

The sun beats down on your small village of Oakhaven. Dust devils dance in the dirt streets, and the air hangs thick with the scent of woodsmoke and ripening barley. The thatch roofs of the cottages bake under the relentless heat. Children chase stray chickens, their laughter a welcome sound against the backdrop of a hardscrabble existence. Your wooden manor house, though modest, is the tallest structure, a symbol of your authority and responsibility.

**What is the overall mood of Oakhaven right now?** (Think of a descriptive word that best fits the current atmosphere)

Now, a messenger arrives, breathless and covered in dust. He kneels before you, presenting a sealed scroll.

"Lord <Player Name>! This arrived this morning. From the King's own scribe, it bears the royal seal!"

You take the scroll, break the seal, and read.

*“To Lord <Player Name> of Oakhaven,*

*Greetings. Our scouts have reported signs of increased goblin activity in the Whispering Woods to the north of your village. These creatures, known for their cruelty and cunning, have been raiding outlying farms and caravans. You are hereby ordered to prepare Oakhaven for potential attacks and to contribute warriors to the royal army assembling in the capital. Failure to comply will be considered treason and will be dealt with severely.*

*By order of His Royal Majesty, King Alaric the Just."*

This is troubling news. The Whispering Woods are close, and goblins are a constant threat, but never this close, and now the King requires soldiers. You must decide how to proceed.

**Scenario 1: The Goblin Threat and the King's Demand**

Your options are as follows:

**A) Focus solely on defense:** Fortify Oakhaven, train the villagers, and hope the goblins bypass your village. Ignore the King's demand for now. (Risk: Angering the King, but prioritizing the safety of your village)
**B) Answer the King's call:** Send a contingent of your best warriors to the capital. This shows loyalty but weakens your defenses at home. (Risk: Leaving Oakhaven vulnerable to goblin attacks)
**C) Negotiate:** Send a messenger to the capital, explaining the situation and offering tribute in lieu of soldiers. (Risk: The King may see this as weakness and refuse, potentially leading to even harsher consequences)
**D) A Proactive Approach:** Send a small group of experienced hunters and trappers into the Whispering Woods to scout out the goblin threat and assess its strength. (Risk: Potentially provoking the goblins, and costing the lives of those sent, but also gaining valuable information.)

**Which option do you choose, Lord <Player Name>? (A, B, C, or D)**
